# Challenger
The Challenger App provides multiple tools to help students enhance their technical skills in
various software development categories and topics. The site will contain three main sections:
Quizzes, Interview Questions, and Speedometer.

Through the Quizzes section students will be able to test their knowledge through different
levels of questions. On the other hand, Interview questions will present a list of top interviews
questions in the selected topic. The speedometer will give the tool for students to practice
coding while their speed is being measured.
